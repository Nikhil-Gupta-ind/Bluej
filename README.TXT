This project includes a huge bundle of codes that I wrote under guidance
of Amanjot Sir using Bluej IDE as a beginner in Xavier's Chandigarh.
Nothing is copied from aywhere else but a piece of either mine of my
teacher's intellectual logic created on the spot. All this helped me get
hands-on experiece and cover a distance in journey with java.
This also includes some packages that includes programms that self learned
later.
